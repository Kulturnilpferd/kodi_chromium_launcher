This is a Kodi Chromium Launcher for Raspberry Pi
Will not work with XBMC or Openelec you need Raspbian with Chromium installed.


=====
Setup
=====
1. Install Raspbian (Desktop Version) on your SD Card and install Chromium on your Raspberry Pi if not installed.
2. Install Kodi (sudo apt-get install kodi)
After this Save this Zip File (remember location) and Start Kodi.

======================
Installation (In Kodi)
======================

Launch Kodi >> Add-ons >> Get More >> .. >> Install from zip file

Enjoy!


Update:
On Raspberry Pi 3B+ you get a proper Chromium Browser but the performance will lack due the capacities of the RPi3 so youtube in HD and other are a problem.
In future I will test it on a Rpi 4. Maybe the 4GB version should give a proper Youtube & other playback ^^
